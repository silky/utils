Small tool to link my notes in Okular with my bibtex references.

Specifically it produces a file for use in vimwiki with a list of
all my 'active' notes. That is to say, notes generated from here
should be transitioned to other areas, this just shows you what you
have noted but have not yet organised into legitimate projects or
comments.

Usage:
  python get_notes.py

See the conf for what to configure.
