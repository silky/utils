About:

 A trivial script to provide some alias' for various repository actions. You can use
the current shell scripts I've provided or modify them to suit your environment, I 
have a ~/bin folder in my path, and this seems to work.

Usage:

 Anywhere in your filesystem, type the commands. If you are in a repository of some
 variety (hg/git) it will detect that (by looking for the folders ".hg" and ".git")
 and then will perform the relevant actions.
