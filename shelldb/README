Tiny script to allow me to write "sel * from table" at the shell.

To use, create the following alias in your shell rc (for me, .zshrc):
    alias sel='noglob sel'

Then you will need to create a .shelldb file in some appropriate directory, and have the following in it:
    [general]
    db = yourdb

Note that this simply uses psql to execute the command, so clearly it will only work for such systems at the moment.
